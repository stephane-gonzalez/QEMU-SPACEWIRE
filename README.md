# QEMU-SPACEWIRE
This project involves implementing a plugin for the Leon3 processor in the QEMU emulator. The plugin simulates the behavior of IP Spacewire provided by Gaisler. The communication bus includes a gateway to connect it to an external remote application, allowing you to simulate a device that would be connected to it
